# NN_ImageCompression
It is a java application to compress and decompress grey images with different sizes using neural network.
Compress image in a verry small size about 400 to 500 Bytes only
of course it is a lossy compression but with good training to system it will recover most of the compressed image correctly it just needs some time during compression.
